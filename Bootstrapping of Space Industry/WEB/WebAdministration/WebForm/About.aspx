        <h4>Develop a simulation of a lunar industry through a series of "bootstrapping" stages until it becomes self-sustaining. The strategy is to decide which machines to build first and how many of them, using resources launched from Earth and available from the Moon. A major part of this challenge is learning what the purpose and value of a lunar industry could be and incorporating it into the game.
